# Define a custom_count method that accepts a string and a string
# of search characters. The method should count how many times the
# search characters appear in the original string. Do not use the
# built-in count method in your solution.
#
# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
# custom_count("Hello World", "l")     => 3
# custom_count("Hello World", "O")     => 0
# custom_count("Hello World", "z")     => 0
# custom_count("Hello World", "lo")    => 5
# custom_count("Hello World", "ol")    => 5
def custom_count(str, search_chars)
  count = 0

  str.each_char do |char|
    count += 1 if search_chars.include?(char)
  end

  count
